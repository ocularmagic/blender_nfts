# blender_nfts
A blender file and Python script to create images and JSON data for NFTs.

These two files will allow you to render images and JSON files for NFT minting.
The Python script is heavily commented to help with understanding.

Here's a link to the medium article that uses these. https://ocularmagic.medium.com/3d-renders-and-json-data-for-nfts-straight-from-blender-by-using-python-a508530f969d

Feel free to use these files for whatever you want with no attribution required. If you're feeling generous, give me a shoutout @ocularmagic on Twitter and Instagram. Hope they help!
